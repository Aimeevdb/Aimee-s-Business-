  <h2>Designing Through Detours</h2>

      <p>When I enrolled in a UX Design course, I didn‚Äôt expect the journey to include Lyft rides, late-night prototyping, and hand surgery. But that‚Äôs exactly how it unfolded.</p>
      <p>By day, I was driving passengers across Portland‚Äîlearning to read people, adapt quickly, and solve problems on the fly. By night, I was wireframing, researching, and presenting design solutions to classmates who had no idea I was working from the front seat of my car between rides.</p>
      <p>Midway through the course, I had surgery on my dominant hand to correct carpal tunnel and trigger thumb. It slowed me down physically, but sharpened my focus. I learned to delegate, prioritize, and advocate for accessibility‚Äînot just in design, but in life.</p>
      <p>This wasn‚Äôt the smoothest path into tech, but it was mine. And it taught me that good design isn‚Äôt just about pixels‚Äîit‚Äôs about persistence, perspective, and people.</p>

  <h2>From Setback to Ascent</h2>

      <p>Two days after the fire, I sat down for an interview with the Ascent Up program. I didn‚Äôt have a permanent address. I barely had a laptop. But I had something stronger: clarity.</p>
      <p>I spoke about my journey‚ÄîLyft driving, UX coursework, late-night prototyping‚Äîand how I‚Äôd learned to design under pressure. Real pressure.</p>
      <p>The interview wasn‚Äôt just a test of skills. It was a test of resilience. And I passed.</p>
      <p>Getting accepted meant more than a paid project. It meant validation. It meant someone saw potential in the messy, real version of me.</p>
      <p>That project became a turning point. I collaborated with developers, scoped deliverables, and shipped something that mattered.</p>
      <p>The fire didn‚Äôt stop me. It lit the way.</p>

  <h2>üå± What Mentamorph Taught Me</h2>
  <p class="date">August 9, 2025</p>

  <div class="blog-text">
    <p>Working on Mentamorph was one of the most rewarding team experiences I‚Äôve had. It was the first time I saw my leadership skills begin to emerge‚Äînot through authority, but through clarity, empathy, and initiative.</p>
    <p>I learned how to communicate across disciplines, balance creative ideas with client needs, and help the team stay focused when things got messy or uncertain.</p>
    <p>Collaborating with both teammates and a real client taught me how to ask better questions, listen actively, and advocate for users while respecting scope and constraints.</p>
    <p>The process challenged me, stretched my thinking, and reminded me how energizing it is to build something with others.</p>
    <p>I left the project more confident, more curious, and deeply grateful‚Äînot just for what we built, but for how we built it together.</p>
